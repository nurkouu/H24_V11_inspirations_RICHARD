## Auteure - Qui est Aude Guivarc'h?
Aude Guivarc'h is a french-canadien artist from Montreal. She is a director and media and digital artist who finds all of her inspirations mainly from the source of her passions which are music, science and nature. To make her projects, Aude uses a lot of 3D modeling, sculpting, interactive installations and digital art and these things help her capt the attention of many eyes that are already involved in the same genre like OSHEAGA Aand MUTEK. Her work solely concentrates on environmental sustainability and social justice. She uses basic economic principles like recycling and reutilization to create.

Something that is unique about her is that she uses things that she finds in scrapes in order to create her projects. So when clients are afraid to interact with a more direct and hard approach to her projects she wants them to know that this is the point of her project. Take for example, *Caverne de Lave*. In order to interact with it, the client must press hard on some parts of the walls for it to be able to react.

She also won many prizes for her work back in 2021. She was awarded for the improvement and further developments of her project *Ecosystem Alpha* and for the audio-visuel video mapping of *Glaciers of sound*.

Finally, because of her creative and very expanded mind, Aude got to collaborate and work with many different big artists such as Billie Eilish, Madonna, Ed Sherr
