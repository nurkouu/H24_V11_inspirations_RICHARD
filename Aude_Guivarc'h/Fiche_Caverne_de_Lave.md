## Description de l'oeuvre
Caverne de Lave, also known as Lava Cave in english, is a multi-sensory installation that's goal is to present the core energy of the insides of earth. The idea for it was that clients would come and sit on the rocks that are designed to be seats and enjoy the audio-visual experience. It was designed to have hard and soft parts that physically represent the crust but really it's to represent the unequivocal powers of Earth. The artist used so many different technical components to make this project happen and with the help of her really expanded knowledge on a lot of things, she got to do this on her own.
